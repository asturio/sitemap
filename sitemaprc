[sitemap]

## Sample configuration file for sitemap.py.
## Uncomment one or more of the following settings and add/change the
## value for it to customize sitemap for your usage.  You'll need 
## to copy this file to .sitemaprc in sitemap's start directory before 
## sitemap will use it.

## The text for the link to main home page from the site map page.
#hometitle=Eric's Home Page

## URL of main home page.  The site map page links to it.
#homepage=http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/

## Text for the "title" tag of the site map page.
#indextitle= Map of Eric's Home Web

## Extra elements (such as "meta" tags) to add to the "head" of the site map page.
#headinfo=

## Prefix for URLs to indexed pages.  The prefix should be the site-relative 
## URL to reach the directory indicated by the start directory.  For example, 
## depending on the web server's configuration, the .sitemaprc in the 
## directory corresponding to http://www.coolsite.com/~linus/Linux/Kernel 
## would probably be Linux/Kernel if the script ran via CGI.  Try running the 
## script with no setting and see what output is generated.  If necessary, 
## enable the debug setting (below) to see what prefix is being used.  Adjust 
## as necessary.
#prefix=
